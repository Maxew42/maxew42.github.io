I'm Maximilien, a french engineering student. My interest are mainly in computer vision, that is what you will find on this blog.
Feel free to contact me on Twitter if you want to chat about ML.
Enjoy

## About the blog posts

I believe in efficient reading, our attention span is sadly not at it's greatest these days and we thus need straight to the point content. However, computer vision is a technical subject and sometimes you need to get your hands dirty to explain a particular subject. So you will often find these little collapsible things in my articles, as a way to digress from the subject will not flooding the main article.

<details>
  <summary> What's inside ?</summary>
$$e^{i\pi}+1=0$$
</details>
In the same effort to prune the content, I will soon create a glossary page to centralize all the recurring definitions I will use in my articles.
