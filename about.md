## About the blog posts

I believe in efficient reading, our attention span is sadly not at it's greatest these days and we thus need straight to the point content. However, computer vision is a technical subject and sometimes you need to get your hands dirty to explain a particular subject. So you will often find these little collapsible things in my articles, as a way to digress from the subject will not flooding the main article.

In the same effort to prune the content, I created a glossary page to centralize all the recurring definitions I will use in my articles.
